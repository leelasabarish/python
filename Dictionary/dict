dictionary  is set of key/value pairs
diff between set and dictionary are if we pass inside the { then it is set if it is empty{} or keys and  values
eg:- dict{key,value}then it is called as dictionary
dictionary is all about key value combinations
keys must be unique
value can have duplicates but not the keys
key act like as index immutable type
key value can be
p{strings,numbers or tuple}
if p has any duplicates it don't act as dictionary
if u want to access the indexing u must need list
